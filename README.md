# Francesco Maiomascio

I design and build AI-native systems with a strong focus on architecture,
runtime orchestration, and developer tooling.

## What I work on
- AI runtimes and orchestration layers  
- Local-first and hybrid AI systems  
- Electron + Python architectures  
- Long-term system design and maintainability  

## Current focus
I’m currently working on a private project centered around an AI-native
workspace and runtime engine.
Some components and experiments will be released publicly over time.

## How I work
- Architecture-first approach  
- Clear separation of concerns  
- Incremental and testable systems  
- Long-term vision over short-term hype
