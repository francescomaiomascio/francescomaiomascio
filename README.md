## Profile

I work on **runtime architecture and execution models** for complex, long-running software systems.

My focus is on:
- execution governance  
- lifecycle-driven systems  
- event-derived state  
- capability-based control models  
- observability and auditability at runtime level  

I approach intelligent systems as **software systems first**,
where inference, agents, and models operate under explicit execution authority.

This work is closer to **systems engineering and runtime design**
than to applied AI or model-centric development.

## Areas of work

- Runtime and execution architecture  
- Long-running and stateful systems  
- Event-sourced and event-derived models  
- Capability-based security and effect control  
- Observability, audit, and traceability  
- Agent-oriented execution environments  

---

## ICE

ICE is an ongoing **research and engineering effort** focused on
the design of a **runtime environment for cognitive and agent-based systems**.

It explores how to:
- make execution explicit and governed  
- derive state exclusively from validated events  
- treat memory as a managed, auditable artifact  
- enforce authority at runtime level, not at model level  

ICE is not a framework and not a product.
It is a system architecture and execution model.

Technical documentation and RFC-style notes are available at:

## Notes

The repositories under `ice-*` are organized as
independent components (runtime, observability, engine, protocols),
designed to evolve in parallel with clear boundaries.

Some parts of the system are intentionally not open source.

## Support

This work is independent and long-term.
