# Francesco Maiomascio

I design and build **AI-native systems and cognitive runtimes** with a strong
focus on **architecture**, **orchestration**, and **long-term system design**.

My work explores how intelligence can be structured, coordinated, and evolved
across code, knowledge, agents, and runtime environments.

## What I work on

- Cognitive runtimes and orchestration layers  
- AI-native, system-level architectures  
- Local-first and hybrid AI systems  
- Electron + Python runtime stacks  
- Long-term maintainability and lifecycle-aware systems  

---

## Current focus

I’m currently working on **ICE Studio** — a private, research-driven project
focused on building an **Integrated Cognitive Environment**.

ICE Studio is not an IDE, a chatbot, or an LLM wrapper.  
It defines a new category of system centered on long-term context,
cognitive orchestration, and runtime awareness.

Selected components, documentation, and experiments are released publicly
over time.

## How I work

- Architecture-first thinking  
- Clear separation of concerns  
- Deterministic and observable systems  
- Incremental evolution over short-term hype

If you find my work valuable, supporting it helps sustain
long-term research, documentation, and system design.
