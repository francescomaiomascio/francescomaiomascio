## Overview

I work on **runtime architecture and execution models** for long-running, stateful, and cognitively-augmented software systems.

My focus is **not** on prompts or model tuning, but on:

- how systems **execute**
- how authority is **enforced**
- how state **emerges, evolves, and can be replayed**
- how behavior remains **observable and governable over time**

I approach AI-enabled systems as **software systems first**.  
Intelligence operates under explicit execution authority, lifecycle rules, and auditable constraints.

---

## Research focus

- Runtime-first system design  
- Execution governance & lifecycle control  
- Event-derived and replayable state  
- Capability-based side-effect management  
- Observability & auditability at runtime level  
- Agent-oriented execution environments  

This work sits at the intersection of:  
**systems engineering · distributed systems · AI infrastructure**

## ICE — Intelligent Cognitive Ecosystem

ICE is an ongoing **research and engineering effort** exploring how to build:

- explicit and governed execution environments  
- deterministic, replayable cognitive processes  
- memory as a validated and managed artifact  
- strict separation between inference and authority  

ICE is **not a framework** and **not a product**.  
It is a runtime architecture and execution model.

## Execution philosophy

> **Models perform inference.**  
> **Runtimes decide what is allowed to happen.**

Complexity is not something to hide.  
It is something to **structure, constrain, and observe**.
