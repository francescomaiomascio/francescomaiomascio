I research **runtime architectures for AI-enabled systems**.

My focus is **execution after inference**: how intelligent behavior is authorized, executed, observed, and governed in long-running systems.

ICE is the environment where this is formalized through explicit constraints:

- **Authority precedes execution** (inference cannot authorize actions)
- **State transitions are explicit and inspectable**
- **Traceability and evidence are structural invariants**
- **Determinism and reproducibility are mandatory properties**
- **External effects are boundary-governed**
- **Transitions are abstractly cost-accountable**

This profile documents the work as it evolves.
