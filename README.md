I work on **runtime architectures** for AI-enabled systems.

I am interested in what happens *after* inference:
how systems **execute**, persist, fail, recover, and remain governable over time.

Rather than treating AI as a standalone artifact,
I study it as a **component embedded in long-running software systems**,
where authority, lifecycle, and side effects are explicit by design.


## Architectural stance

My work is shaped by a set of non-negotiable constraints:

- **Execution precedes intelligence**  
- **Authority must be explicit**, never emergent  
- **State changes must be deterministic and replayable**  
- **Inference and control must remain separated**  
- **Observability is not optional**

These constraints are architectural, not ideological.
They exist to make systems inspectable, auditable, and correct over time.


## Systems I care about

I am drawn to systems that:

- live for long periods  
- accumulate memory and responsibility  
- interact with humans, services, and other agents  
- cannot afford undefined behavior  

These are systems where **failure is expected**,
and therefore must be *observable, controllable, and reversible*.

This space includes AI agents, orchestration layers,
cognitive runtimes, and execution environments
designed to survive contact with reality.


## ICE — Intelligent Cognitive Ecosystem

ICE is the result of a specific research question.

In this context, **intelligent** and **cognitive** are not synonyms.  
*Intelligent* refers to a system’s ability to act toward goals under constraints.  
*Cognitive* refers to how that behavior persists over time: how state is accumulated, validated, authorized, and governed.

ICE studies the space where the two meet: **intelligence as an executable property of long-running systems**.

Rather than focusing on models, prompts, or isolated agents, ICE is concerned with what happens *after inference*: runtimes, orchestration layers, execution control, authority, memory, and observability. Intelligence is treated not as something invoked, but as something **run**.

The term *ecosystem* reflects this scope. ICE looks at how engines, agents, orchestration strategies, protocols, and providers interact — and how behavior remains inspectable and governable as systems scale and architectures change.

Much of today’s AI discourse revolves around capabilities and risks, acceleration and regulation. Models improve, agents multiply, new architectures and orchestration techniques emerge almost daily. There is abundance, experimentation, and rapid local optimization.

Yet a more fundamental question remains largely implicit:

**What does it mean to reliably run intelligent systems over time — when architectures change, agents proliferate, and control can no longer be assumed by default?**

ICE exists to explore that question.
