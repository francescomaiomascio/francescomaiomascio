## YAI — Sovereign Architecture

YAI is not an AI framework.  
It is a **runtime with law**.

A layered execution system where:

- State is durable
- Authority is explicit
- Events are replayable
- Boundaries are formalized
- Providers are trust-scoped
- Intelligence is sandboxed

If it cannot be reconstructed from logs, it does not exist.

---

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

```
law → axioms, invariants, formal specs (TLA+)
kernel → authority, bootstrap, enforcement (C11)
engine → deterministic execution + scaling surface (C11)
mind → orchestration + cognition (Rust)
docs → specs, datasets, stress tests
```

### Law
- Axioms (Execution / Authority / State / Adaptability)
- Determinism invariants
- Governance invariants
- External effect boundaries
- Formal TLA+ specs

### Kernel (C11)
- Bootstrap boundary
- Session management
- Enforcement FSM
- Vault binding
- Transport + identity

### Engine (C11)
- Storage gate
- Agent enforcement
- Runtime bridge
- Deterministic event flow
- Cortex (statistical scaling surface — no ML)

### Mind (Rust)
- Provider lifecycle
- Memory (semantic / episodic / vector)
- RAG pipeline
- RPC + UDS
- LLM adapters (gated, audited, authority-aware)

---

## DOCTRINE

> *"Code is ephemeral. State is truth. Authority must be earned."*

YAI enforces:

- Deterministic replay
- Hard-fail on violation
- Formal trust store for providers
- Audit-first lifecycle
- Capability-gated orchestration

LLMs do not execute.
They propose.
The Kernel authorizes.

---

## CURRENT PHASE

We are not in feature expansion.

We are in structural consolidation:

- Provider lifecycle formalized
- Trust store persistent + signed
- Deterministic event replay
- Engine scaling via statistical surface (EWMA + hysteresis)
- Embedding ONNX local, offline capable

This is infrastructure work.
Not prompt engineering.

## TECH STACK

```
C11 • Rust • TLA+ • SQLite • ONNX • UDS • Deterministic Logging
```


No frameworks.
No black boxes.
No magic.

YAI is structural research.
It prioritizes invariants over speed, authority over automation, and determinism over convenience.
