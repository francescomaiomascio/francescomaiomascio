# Francesco Maiomascio
I build systems that don’t lie.

Most software runs on vibes: hidden authority, accidental side-effects, unverifiable outcomes.  
That’s fine for demos.  
It’s unacceptable for machines that steer decisions, money, and reality.  

I’m here for the opposite:  
**sovereign runtimes** where power is explicit, behavior is reproducible, and failures are observable — not explained away.

## The thesis

AI won’t “align” itself by being polite.
It will align when the machine is forced to be accountable.

If you can’t answer, precisely:
- who had the authority,
- what changed,
- and how to replay it,

then you don’t have a system.
You have a story.

I build machines that replace stories with evidence.

## What I’m building

A new kind of runtime where:
- decisions have **owners**,
- actions have **limits**,
- and the system can be audited like a ledger.

Not “agents that feel smart”.
**Executors under law.**

Not “observability later”.
**Traceability from day one.**

Not “move fast and patch”.
**Make the machine unable to cheat.**

## Why

Because the next decade won’t be defined by the best model.
It will be defined by who can ship AI that is:
- governable,
- replayable,
- and resistant to bullshit.

The future is not more abstraction. It's **hard boundaries**.

## What I care about

- Sovereign execution and capability boundaries
- Determinism as a product feature
- Governance that survives scale and pressure
- Systems designed to be proven wrong (and still hold)
- AI orchestration that is constrained, not “creative”

### One-liner

Governed execution. Deterministic truth. No vibes.
