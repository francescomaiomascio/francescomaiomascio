I research **runtime architectures for AI-enabled systems**.

My work focuses on what happens *after inference*: how intelligent systems execute, persist state, evolve, fail, recover, and remain governable over time.  
I do not treat intelligence as a model capability or a prompt interaction, but as an **executable property of long-running systems**.

The systems I study are defined by a small set of constraints:  
**execution precedes intelligence**, authority is explicit, state transitions are deterministic and inspectable, and inference is strictly separated from control.  
I am interested in architectures that operate continuously, accumulate responsibility over time, and remain correct under failure, evolution, and scale.

**ICE** is the research environment where this work converges.

ICE explores a single question:  
*what does it mean to reliably run intelligent systems over time?*

Here, *intelligent* and *cognitive* are not synonyms.  
**Intelligent** systems act toward goals under constraints.  
**Cognitive** systems persist behavior across time: they accumulate state, validate it, authorize it, and govern its evolution during execution.

ICE studies the intersection of these two dimensions.  
Intelligence is treated as something that is **run**, not invoked.  
The focus is not on models or isolated agents, but on *after-inference dynamics*: runtimes, orchestration layers, execution control, authority, memory, and observability.

As architectures evolve and systems scale, control can no longer be assumed by default.  
ICE exists to study how intelligent behavior can remain reliable under change.
