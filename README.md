I design and build **integrated cognitive systems** and **orchestration engines**
focused on **long-term intelligence**, **context continuity**, and
**system-level coordination** across software and hardware.

My work is centered on how complex systems can be composed, separated,
and recombined into **adaptive, multi-domain cognitive environments**.

---

## What I build

- Cognitive engines and orchestration runtimes  
- Domain-driven AI system architectures  
- Agent-based coordination models  
- Local-first and hybrid AI infrastructures  
- Long-lived systems with explicit lifecycle boundaries

## ICE Studio — current core project

I am currently developing **ICE Studio**, the first concrete interface
built on top of the **ICE ecosystem**.

ICE Studio is **not**:
- an IDE clone
- a chatbot
- an LLM wrapper
- a monolithic AI application

ICE Studio is an **Integrated Cognitive Environment**:
a system designed to coordinate **agents, knowledge, memory, and execution**
through a strict separation of domains and contracts.

It acts as:
- a **research platform**
- a **development environment**
- a **reference implementation** of the ICE architecture

---

## The ICE ecosystem (high-level)

ICE is structured as a set of **independent but composable domains**:

- **ICE API**  
  Canonical language, domains, and contracts shared by all components.

- **ICE AI**  
  Declarative definitions of agents, capabilities, and reasoning intent.
  No execution, no runtime, no side effects.

- **ICE Engine**  
  The orchestration core.
  Executes, schedules, routes, and coordinates systems using ICE AI contracts.

- **ICE Conscious** *(in development)*  
  Decision logic, behavioral rules, and long-term contextual filtering.
  Not memory storage, but cognitive regulation.

- **ICE Studio GUI**  
  One possible interface over the ecosystem.
  Not the system itself, but a vessel.

Each domain is **replaceable**, **scalable**, and **reusable**
across different products, interfaces, and industries.

---

## Design principles

- Architecture before features  
- Strict separation of concerns  
- Declarative contracts over implicit behavior  
- Orchestration over raw intelligence  
- Systems that remain understandable at scale  

---

## Long-term direction

ICE is designed to support **multiple future engines**:
- behavioral engines
- emotional engines
- mobility and embedded systems
- security and infrastructure orchestration
- domain-specific cognitive runtimes

ICE Studio is only the first surface.
The underlying system is meant to **outlive any single application**.

## Support

If you believe in long-term, architecture-driven AI systems
and want to support the development of ICE:

- GitHub Sponsors  
  https://github.com/sponsors/francescomaiomascio

- Buy Me a Coffee  
  https://buymeacoffee.com/francescomaiomascio

Your support sustains independent research,
documentation, and the development of systems
designed to scale beyond short-term products.
